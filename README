COMPILATION

You can use the Code::Blocks project files.

Linux

Just compile the _.cpp which is the main file.

g++ -I/usr/include/SDL/ -I3rdparty/OpenGLext/include _.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lpng -lSDL -o cpv

You will need to install libsdl, libpng and libgl development files for the compilation.

Windows

If you have MinGW installed it's basically the same, but in this case you will need to 
include all paths manually.

g++ -mwindows -I3rdParty/libpng/include -I3rdParty/SDL/include/SDL -I3rdParty/OpenGLext/include -I3rdParty/zlib/include _.cpp libmingw32.a libSDLmain.a libSDL.dll.a libopengl32.a libpng.dll.a libglu32.a -o cpv.exe

USAGE

cpv <filename>

It currently supports only PNG.
An example image provided.

You can look around by using the arrow keys, and Q and E.

It outputs text the the stdout. But on Windows it outputs it to a file called stdout.txt (that's because of the SDL).

KNOWN ISSUES

The movement speed is aribrarily chosen which can be too slow for some computers or insane fast for some others. 
Change the ANGLE_STEP constant in the applyRotation functions, if you want to change it.
